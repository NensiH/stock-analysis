# Stock-analysis
## Overview of Project

Steve's parents are passionate about Green Energy and there are many form of Green energy to invest in. They haven't done much research and invest theit money in DAQO new energy corp which makes solar panels and it's Ticker symbol is 'DQ'. So, Steve wants to do much analysis for other stocks options as well as DQ.

## Purpose
As, Steve's parents were interested to invest in 'DQ', We are helping them in details of stock analysis through VBA code. Here, We are using Stocks data from the year 2017 and 2018. 
Since Daqo might not be the best option for Steve's parents to invest in,we are analyzing multiple stocks to find some better choices for them. Repurposed to analyze any stock. With a little more code, we can analyze a whole list of stocks. 
 
## Analysis and Challenges
 After doing research and Analysis Steve find out that DQ dropped over 63% in 2018 and he want to offer some better stocks to his parents.
 
 Defining and using multiple variables and for loops we have created a flexible macro for running multiple stocks for 2018 and 2017.

To make this easy to understandable and readable for Steve, we are formating tables like changing font styles, adding borders, setting number formats, and so onâ€”but we can automate formatting with VBA. Also, Steve wanted a button that would be easier and more user-friendly to run any year Analysis.

Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Here, we are refactoring this code successfully made the VBA script run faster.

### DQ Analysis
Steve wants to know how DQ performed in 2018. One way to measure this is to calculate the yearly return for DQ. The yearly return is the percentage increase or decrease in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. In other words, if you invested in DQ at the beginning of the year and never sold, the yearly return is how much your investment grew or shrunk by the end of the year.

Here is the results Steve got for 2018 DQ stock Analysis, dropped over 63% in 2018:

### All stocks Analysis
   Since DQ was not the best option Steve wants to check all stocks returns for the years of 2017 and 2018, as well as may want to look at a different set of stocks in the future with the refactoring method and check whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

It took a while to fix the code when changed the code to refactor. Also got many times errors in For loops and tikerindex. 

## Results

****What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?


****How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
